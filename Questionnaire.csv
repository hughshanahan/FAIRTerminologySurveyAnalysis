I could use this as a filter to select appropriate texts but I would still need to review the hits to assess the quality/depth of the material.

For the FAIR-related job application assessment: The use of terms in a CV doesn't guarantee the suitability of a candidate. This assumes that all candidates describe their skills and experience in a consistent way. --- For article quality control: Mentioning terms in an article doesn't guarantee that the steps have been taken. Similarly, researchers may not explicitly mention steps they have taken although they have been applied.

Difficulty I feel here is that the use of the terminology might be righteous, but to what extent can we select the best candidate using it? The assumption is that the more the cv contains terms from the terminology, the better the candidate. I would say that the use case is a reasonable example in the case the given suggestions were then to be judged by humans. The situation might occur that an applicant uses a lot of detailed terms, as ""cv filling"", but knows only the basics, let's call that a false positive. Best structuring would be an ontology, given the relations between different entities within the field. And on a more general level: if an applicant were to apply for a job in this field, are we not automatically within the domain of the FAIR4S terminology? Is this automated job application assessment therefore necessary?

For the Article quality control case: I feel like there are some steps missing. For example: how can we determine the article's quality, given only the used terms for FAIR-related competencies? This has to do with the validity of the tool, i.e. is it measuring the paper's quality, or the overlap the paper shows with the terminology. One is not inherent to the other, i think. My feeling is that in this case, the terminology would have only quantitative impact (i.e.: how many FAIR-related papers have we published) over qualitative content (i.e. how FAIR are our datasets? The step between these two is human-centered; a professional in the field has to judge whether or not quality pursued is obtained. Case 2 and 3 are equivalent in this sense.

For the data repository uploader skill check: absolutely a significant use case, depicting well the interchangeable concept of 'quality': we would always need human judgement. The use of the terminology in this case can support the enhancement of professional skills within the FAIR-framework.",Yes this is a reasonable example.,"Input: like case 4, the human aspect is important. The FAIR-terminology and -competency framework support a human decision-making process.","Case 6a: Finding FAIR and trusted digital repositories
The data-management departement of a mid-sized university would like to provide a list of preferred repositories for their researchers to deposit data. The university has a number of standards which the repositories have to fulfil. These not only cover the repositories’ trustworthiness (TDRs) but to a large extent also concern the FAIR maturity level. Using the terms within the terminology and entering them in an online repository finder tool, the data-management department finds the most suitable and mature repositories.   

Case 6b: Ensuring research output is FAIR, for TDR's 
As a leading researcher in the field of information and data sciences, I am responsible and accountable for your research areas activities and behaviour. I am aware of legal and ethical aspects of the research you conduct, including the FAIR-principles that make your and your team's outputs FAIR. My knowledge and understanding of the FAIR terminology and the FAIR4S framework enables you to fulfil the synergetic role of intermediary between research outputs on the one hand, and trusted repositories on the other hand.","Data repository uploader skills check, Curriculum design, The other use cases I have described",Ontology,"Given the generic nature of ontologies - containing entities of a certain domain, thesauri and controlled vocabularies might become part of an ontology of FAIR terminologies.
