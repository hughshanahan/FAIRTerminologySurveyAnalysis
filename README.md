# FAIRTerminologySurveyAnalysis
Results of the analysis of the FAIR terminology survey

If you download this to play around with the analysis then probably the best thing is to focus on analysis.Rmd.

It's all written in R so apologies if you were expecting it all in Python...

The HTML version of the report can be inspected going to
